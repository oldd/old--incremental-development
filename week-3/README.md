* [wireframe.cc - online wireframes](https://wireframe.cc/)

### Git, GitHub & GitKraken

This module's main objective is to learn how Git & GitHub can be used to organize your development process.  Come prepared for Sunday's activities by studying these links:

* [git & github for poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV)
* [LearnGitBranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) & [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG0ke9vILQM) - complete the first set of exercises
* [Familiarize yourself with GitKraken](https://support.gitkraken.com/start-here/interface/)
* [Study this example project](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/built-with-branches)
* [Understand how to use Atomic Commits](https://curiousprogrammer.io/blog/how-to-craft-your-changes-into-small-atomic-commits-using-git)

## Assignments

This week there is 1 project, and 2 exercise sets.

### Project

> [Open-Ended](http://hackyourfuture.be/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to build your own accessible & responsive clone of the [DuckDuckGo home page](https://duckduckgo.com).  We don't expect your DOM to be identical to DuckDuckGo's, but the rendered site should be visually as close as possible. Unlike the last two weeks, this project does not have a video tutorial for you to follow.  You're on your own! Here are some skills that will come in handy:

* [Finding which colors a website uses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Inspect_and_select_colors)
* [Which fonts a website uses](https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-see-what-fonts-a-website-is-using/)
* [Which images a website uses](https://www.lifewire.com/copy-image-web-address-url-1174175)

You will be expected to turn in your code for this project in a clone/fork of [this repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/duck-duck-clone/), cleanly developed with __one branch per page section__.  Take a look through [this example repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/built-with-branches) to get an idea of what an incrementally developed project looks like.  Be sure to also clone this repository and study it using GitKraken/VSC/Browser to explore what happens when you check out different branches.

This week you will also expected to have entirely _correct_ and _accessible_ HTML & CSS. Your coaches will be using the validation buttons on your deployed page, and the accessibility audit build into Chrome Devtools to check for any mistakes.  Since these tools are also available to you, you will be able find and fix any errors on your own before submission. Any validation errors left when you submit your work will land your project in "NEEDS REVISION".

Your repository must contain:

* A README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)
* One well-named branch per user story. If we check out any branch, it should contain _only_ the code necessary to make that step work. and it should work!
* A file called `development-strategy.md` in which you explain how you broke the project into user stories, describe each user story, and describe what code you wrote to implement this user story.  Check out the [tomato timer code-along](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/tomato-timer-code-along/blob/master/development-strategy.md) for an example.
* Include your _wireframe_ in the `development-strategy.md` along with a little explanation of why you made it like you did.  You can either include a link if you use [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc), or upload an image if you use another tool.

But wait! Before you dive right in, take a minute to set up your homework on the module project board:

1. Clone [duck-duck-clone](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/duck-duck-clone/)
1. [Create a homework issue](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/homework-submission#homework-issues) if you haven't yet.
1. Get coding!

### Exercises

There are 3 sets of exercises to start (and probably not finish, there's a lot this week).

* In [HTML-CSS-Practice-Problems](https://github.com/DevMountain/HTML-CSS-Practice-Problems):
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Complete the exercises in `./level-3`
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
* In [css-exercises](https://github.com/dangodev/css-exercises)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Complete `exercise-6` and `exercise-8`
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!
* Fork & Clone [html-css-git-exercises](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/html-css-git-exercises)
  * Turn on GitHub Pages
  * Begin the exercises.  There is no specific assignment, just a lot more practice available to keep your HTML/CSS sharp throughout the next modules
  * Push your work regularly, so you can ask questions with issues!

Looking for an extra challenge? Try solving each exercise on a different branch!
