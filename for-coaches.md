## Code-Alongs

Code-alongs are the best thing you can do for students on a Sunday.  Built into each lesson plan you'll find two types of code-alongs:

1. __Embedded__: These are small samples of code embedded into the first part of the lesson plan for covering new material.  The source code for these are hosted as separate files in each week's folder.  Embedded code-alongs are meant to isolate and illustrate specific language features or techniques rather than show full projects.  You aren't expected to cover each one in detail in the first part of class, an overview is enough.  There are so many examples for students to review during the week and to act as a reference during the stand-alone code-along after break.
1. __Stand-Alone__: This is the full project you will build along with the students in the second half of class.  Each one is hosted in a separate repository so students can practice starting from scratch, using branches, and managing source code. They are intentionally open-ended to give you a chance to adapt to the previous week's confusions and student questions. You can find each one linked to in the week's lesson plan, or by filtering for the `code-along` & `incremental-development` tags in our GitHub Organization.

Please take a minute to look through the embedded code-alongs for each Sunday before coming to make sure you have an idea how you'll solve it on Sunday.

## Class Recordings

Recording your screen and your voice in class is enormously helpful to students over the week.  Feel free to use whatever softwares you're comfortable with, and to host the video however you like.  Just make sure to send a PR to [study.hackyourfuture.be/class-recordings](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/class-recordings) for posterity :)
